# Prompt Optimizer

A powerful skill for optimizing and enhancing prompts for AI assistants. This skill helps you refine prompts for better clarity, effectiveness, and results.

## Description

The Prompt Optimizer skill analyzes and improves prompts by:
- Enhancing clarity and specificity
- Structuring prompts for better AI comprehension
- Adding relevant context and constraints
- Optimizing for desired output format
- Incorporating best practices for prompt engineering

## Usage

### Basic Optimization

Ask the skill to optimize your prompt:

```
Please optimize this prompt: "Write a function to sort an array"
```

### Advanced Features

- **Context Enhancement**: Adds relevant context to improve AI understanding
- **Structure Improvement**: Organizes prompts with clear sections and formatting
- **Constraint Addition**: Suggests helpful constraints and requirements
- **Output Format Specification**: Defines expected output format and structure
- **Best Practices**: Applies prompt engineering best practices

### Examples

**Before:**
```
Write a function to sort an array
```

**After:**
```
Create a JavaScript function that:
- Takes an array of numbers as input
- Sorts the array in ascending order
- Returns the sorted array
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs
- Uses efficient sorting algorithm (O(n log n) or better)
- Includes JSDoc comments
```

**Before:**
```
Explain machine learning
```

**After:**
```
Provide a comprehensive explanation of machine learning that:
- Defines machine learning in simple terms
- Explains the key concepts (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning)
- Includes real-world examples
- Describes common algorithms (decision trees, neural networks, etc.)
- Uses analogies to make concepts accessible to beginners
- Limits the explanation to 500 words
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your goals**: Clearly state what you want to achieve with the optimized prompt
2. **Provide context**: Share information about your use case and target audience
3. **Iterate**: Use the optimized prompt and refine further if needed
4. **Specify constraints**: Mention any limitations like length, format, or style preferences

## Parameters

- `prompt`: The original prompt to optimize (required)
- `context`: Additional context about the use case (optional)
- `outputFormat`: Desired format for the optimized prompt (optional)
- `constraints`: Any specific constraints or requirements (optional)

## Output

The skill returns:
- Optimized prompt with enhanced clarity and structure
- Explanation of improvements made
- Suggestions for further refinement (if applicable)

## Use Cases

- **Development**: Optimize prompts for code generation, debugging, or documentation
- **Content Creation**: Enhance prompts for writing articles, blog posts, or marketing copy
- **Data Analysis**: Refine prompts for data exploration, visualization, or insights
- **Learning**: Improve prompts for educational content, tutorials, or explanations
- **Problem Solving**: Structure prompts for complex problem-solving tasks

## Integration

This skill can be combined with other skills for enhanced results:
- Use with code generation skills for better code quality
- Combine with analysis skills for deeper insights
- Pair with documentation skills for comprehensive guides
